  * Structured Literature Review
    * The outcomes
    * The practicalities
  * PhD research plan
  * PhD in business, experiences
  * ESNs as more controllable recurrent nets
  * Research into mistakes typically made by auditors / regulators
    * Mistakes should reflect situations in ML systems well
    * Do a survey with someone who'd like to work on this
  * Something on RL?
* Random idea snippets page?
  * Incrementally learning models for RL (incremental GBM?)
    * How to explore ? <- use some model of uncertainty
  * 
  * Active Learning for RL -> when rewards need to be collected from a human?
    * When there is a single reward at the end of an episode such as in dialogue systems
      * Other examples?
      * Combine with ongoing rewards
    * Relation to fitness function being human/user-defined in EA's
    * Need to have some sort of
  * A data science project to predict 'negatief reisadvies' based on news / twitter
    * NER to identify news items on countries / regions
    * history of negatief reisadviezen:
      * e.g. [Twitter](https://twitter.com/search?l=&q=Reisadvies%20from%3A247BZ%20until%3A2016-01-01&src=typd)
  * An app that lets you keep track of your phrasings & proposes common mistakes
  * An app that suggests alternative wording in papers
  * An app that analyses your writing and compares it with a target venue
  * An app to keep track of words / sentences you've encountered and liked and used
  * An app/plugin that selects the 'best' google scholar citation e.g. no arxiv etc.
  * Parallelized Dynamic Time Warping
  * Personalized Vocabulary Notebook
  * Parallel Dynamic Time Warping + kNN as a replacement for recurrent nets
    * What is already done on this topic?
    * For example python fastdtw seems to work on Spark
    * https://github.com/MaxBenChrist/Fast-Parallel-DTW-kNN-Python
  * ...
* Include dask app
  * using hugo 'shortcode' using an iframe?
* Canvas for RL
  * Similar to all types of canvases in project management etc.
  * E.g. Machine Learning Canvas
* parallize largest_number project
* Analogy of read speeds:
  * L1 Cache,1 seconds,grab a piece of paper and look at it
	L2 Cache,14 seconds,pick up a book from nearby shelf
	Memory,4 minutes,walk to coffee machine and get a coffee
	Disk,15 months,travel the world in search of a specific person who happens to know the answer

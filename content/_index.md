My name is Floris den Hengst and I am a PostDoc working on reinforcement
learning for patient-centric decision-making in the [Hybrid Intelligence
centre](https://www.hybrid-intelligence-centre.nl/) with Annette ten Teije at
the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam and Herke van Hoof at the University of
Amsterdam.

I am interested in adaptivity v.s. control in learning systems, sequential
decision-making problems, goal and constraint specification and uncertainty
quantification. My research touches on practical and fundamental aspects of
explainability and safety of AI.

I performed my PhD research in the [Quantitative Data
Analytics](https://www.qda.cs.vu.nl) and [Learning &
Reasoning](https://lr.cs.vu.nl/) groups of the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam and
ING's [AI for FinTech Research](https://se.ewi.tudelft.nl/ai4fintech/) and have
hands-on experience as a software engineer and data scientist.

* I am part of the [Hybrid Intelligence Center](https://www.hybrid-intelligence-centre.nl/)
* I am a member of the [Network Institute](https://networkinstitute.org/)
* I am a member of [Amsterdam AI](https://amsterdamai.com/en)
* I am PC member and reviewer for various journals and conferences, including ECAI, ICAPS and ACL
  conferences.

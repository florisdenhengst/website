I am currently (2024) involved in teaching two courses:
* I coordinate the Msc. course [Data Mining Techniques](https://studiegids.vu.nl/en/courses/2023-2024/X_400108#/)
* I taught a guest lecture for the Msc. course [Machine Learning & Reasoning for Health](https://studiegids.vu.nl/EN/courses/2023-2024/XM_0102#/)

I have previously been involved in organising the [Reinforcement Learning Summer School](https://rlsummerschool.com/), read more in this [blog post](http://localhost:1313/posts/reinforcement-learning-summer-school/).

I also supervise Bsc. and Msc. theses, see below for a (historical) overview of projects.

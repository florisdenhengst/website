Past week, I attended and assisted at the [Reinforcement Learning Summer
School](https://rlsummerschool.com) organized by Vincent Fran√ßois-Lavet. We had
some great lectures on a wide variety of topics, including pure exploration in
bandits, MCTS, exploration, symmetries and state similarities, world models,
hierarchical and distributational RL.

The summer school was hosted at one the theatre halls of VU's new building (see
pictures), which serves as a movie theatre at night: great seats and air
quality *do* help with focusing 8+ hours on challenging topics!  A fun detail
was the dramatic Indiana Jones score randomly starting at the end of the final
talk by Marc G. Bellemare.

The two-year COVID-induced hiatus for in-person events did not result in less
interaction. On the contrary: participants were eager to respond to questions
from lecturers, pose questions and share ideas all around.

Personally, I was involved in assisting for the practical sessions, which was a
proved to be a very way to get familiar with the technical content, but also to
know the participants individually.

Additionally, I was responsible for organising a quiz on the summer school's
content near the end. This made me appreciate the talks a lot more, because I
had to take notes to ensure my questions made sense. Additionally, it made me
appreciate how hard it is to come up with questions that strike the right
balance between being clear, unambiguous, challenging and fun.

The social event was (big surprise!) a boat tour of Amsterdam's canals with
lunch and drinks and ended the week with a `pizza dinner'. This turned out to be a
great opportunities to talk both about work and other interests such as music,
history and the life of a PhD student in RL.

A paper on Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) for strategic workforce planning co-authored with Yannick Smit, Sandjai Bhulai and Ehsan Mehdad is accepted as a long paper at [LOD](http://lod2022.icas.cc/).

In this paper, we model strategic workforce planning as a stochastic nonlinear optimization problem, learn a generative model from data and use it as a simulator in a simulation-optimization approach.

We show that the DRL approach enables optimizing an organizations' strategic workforce goals *directly*. It significantly outperforms the strong linear programming-based baseline on a strategic objective while closely approaching it an operational objective.

Details and preprint will follow.

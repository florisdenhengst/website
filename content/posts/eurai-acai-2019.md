Just returned from a lovely stay in Chania, Crete for the [Advanced Course on Artificial
Intelligence](http://acai2019.tuc.gr/), a yearly summer school by [EurAI](https://www.eurai.org/).
Besides the beautiful scenery and lovely people, there were lots of interesting talks to enjoy.
Most talks stuck to the theme 'AI for multi-agent worlds' quite well.

Although I learned a lot in general, there were some key take-aways for me:

* virtually any setting has some multi-agent aspect to it, but it might not be worthwile to
  actually take it into account
* when going from a single- to a multi-agent setting, typically requires engineering and analysis
  of the resulting system from a game-theoretic point of view. Lots of the presented work had some
  deep connection with game theory, which is quite exciting in my point of view.
* going from single- to a multi-agent setting -- unfortunately -- typically also results in
  problem spaces that are much harder: they are typically intractable, multimodal and sometimes
  even unstable. Typical solutions to get out involve leveraging some feature of the problem
  domain or resorting to approximation.
* evaluation in the multi-agent domain may be quite challenging. Take the adversarial setting of
  learning to play a game. Here, a version \\(n\\) of an agent may beat version \\(n-1\\) but be
  beaten by version \\(n-2\\).

Overall, the summer school was well organized and was happy to meet many awesome people working on
interesting problems in the AI space.

Upcoming weekend will be a [virtual conference](https://sites.google.com/view/RL4RealLife) on reinforcement learning (RL) in real-life.

It is of great interest to me primarily due to its program but also due to its organisation.

The virtual conference consists of two panel sessions and a virtual `poster' session with
pre-recorded videos. There is a slack workspace for discussion, and questions to the panelists can
be submitted up-front. Poster presenters are to host their own video channel. The two panel
sessions start at times convenient to the US Atlantic and Pacific coast.

Our [survey](/posts/rl-for-pers-survey/) of reinforcement learning (RL)-based approaches to
personalization is included as a `poster':

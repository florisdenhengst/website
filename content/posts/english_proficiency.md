Teaching staff that active in one of our English programmes has to prove that their English level is at [EFSET C1](https://www.efset.org/cefr/c1/).

I am happy to share that, based on an oral assessment with two examiners from the [VU language centre](https://www.taalcentrum-vu.nl/en/), my English level has been assessed as [C2](https://www.efset.org/cefr/c2/).

I am still allowed to teach Msc. courses!

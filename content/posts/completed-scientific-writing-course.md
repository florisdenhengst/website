I just completed the course 'Writing a Scientific Article' at the [VU Language
Centre](https://www.taalcentrum-vu.nl/en/training/academic-english/writing-a-scientific-article).
Although I joined the course thinking I knew a fair share of writing in English, I learned a great
deal about *scientific* writing and picked up some neat tricks to improve writing.
As a bonus, I got some great feedback on an survey paper on Reinforcement Learning for
personalization I'm working on with some colleagues in [our group](https://www.cs.vu.nl/ci/)

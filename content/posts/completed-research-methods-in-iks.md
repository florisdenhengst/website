I completed the [SIKS](https://www.siks.nl) course 'Research Methods and Methodology in IKS',
spanning a wide range of topics such as research methods, Design Research, many issues involved
with evaluation in ML and how the field of IR has a strong history of rigourous evaluation (much
to learn there for ML/RL researchers!).

To top it all off, the course was held in the lovely location (see picture) and with lots of great
minds from all over The Netherlands. Great course for first-year PhD in information systems
research.

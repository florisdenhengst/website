## An artisans stance towards writing  
Writing papers, blogposts and even tweets can be cumbersome and time-consuming.  Any writing
requires a confrontation with your own thoughts and therefore --in a certain way-- with yourself.

The best way for me to approach writing is to view it as a craft. To take joy in honing the craft
of communication through written text. To invest time to learn from masters, to practice, to
develop an own style and invest in tooling such as a [personal
vocabulary](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15cE0YtCQubEJPCN3480xe99r4-_CKzWxGRds13AMvIw/edit?usp=sharing).

An artisans stance towards writing makes me a better researcher. It makes me view writing as an
activity in its own right. An activity that requires practice and patience. An activity that can
only be rushed at the cost of quality.

We have contributed papers to the health care workshop and demo track of the [Hybrid Human AI
Conference](https://hhai-conference.org/2024/).  Our contributions target the development of a
lifestyle support chatbot for diabetes patients based on knowledge, semantic user modeling and
active information gathering.

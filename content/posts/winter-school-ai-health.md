I contributed a talk on guideline-informed reinforcement learning with Annette ten Teije to the [AI & Health Winter School](https://www.ai-health.nl/ai-health-winter-school-2024/) organized by the VU Campus Center Artificial Intelligence & Health.

The winter school was attended by over 100 in-person and virtual participants interested in the intersection of AI & Health.

You may find the slides which focus on how the knowledge-driven AI (information in the guidelines) was combined with reinforcement learning (learning optimal decisions from data) [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dOA8nXcsBINiRuE-B0v0OehO0OBj6MmA/view).

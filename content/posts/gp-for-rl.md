* Gaussian Processes are a fascinating tool for usage in RL due to modelling uncertainty and data efficiency
* I have briefly introduced GP's and shown how/why they are used in RL and inspire for other
  approaches

Gaussian Processes (GP) are a fascinating tool for regression in Reinforcement Learning (RL) as naturally
model uncertainty and can be very data efficient. Although GPs are a very generic Machine Learning
tool, can be used for both regression and classification and have been around for a long time, I
was first introduced to them when studying [ways to apply RL to dialogue
control](/posts/rl-for-dialogue-management). In this post, I hope to provide you with some
understanding of GPs (or at least some pointers!), explain how they can be used in RL and why they
are especially interesting. If you won't like them for their mathematical properties, I'm sure
you'll like the visualizations and videos throughout this blog post.

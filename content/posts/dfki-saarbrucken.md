I visited Verena Wolf's [Neuro-Mechanistic Modeling](https://www.dfki.de/en/web/research/research-departments/neuro-mechanistic-modeling) in Saarbrücken and met with her many interesting group members there to discuss RL, safety, formal methods and RL, and causality.

The visit was a great opportunity to discuss recent trends and share ideas.

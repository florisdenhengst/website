Today I completed the [HPC](https://hpc.labs.vu.nl/) course at VU University. The course was well
organized and had some interesting courses. Some of the courses contained very little new
information for me, though. I would recommend researchers/PhD. Students with some knowledge of
programming/bash, Linux and clusters but with no experience working with SurfSARAs offerings to
follow the following courses:

* Intro to distributed systems & BigData: optional refresher
* Intro to Linux and Clustercomputing: take, become familiar with [Lisa](https://userinfo.surfsara.nl/systems/lisa/)
* Intro to MPI parallel programming concepts: take, get familiar with [Cartesius](https://userinfo.surfsara.nl/systems/cartesius)
* Datamanagement: take to become familiar with various data storage/archiving solutions and make a data management plan for your research
* HPC Cloud: optional if interested in virtualization
* GPU Computing: as a refresher, somewhat theoretical
* Singularity with containerized applications: optional if interested in reproducibility using containers (e.g. Docker)
* Scientific Visualization: optional, if you like making nice graphs
* Data intensive computing (spark/hadoop): take, pretty hands-on and very useful in industry collaborations
